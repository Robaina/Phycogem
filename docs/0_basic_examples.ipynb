    "# Genome-scale metabolic modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Metabolic reactions underpin cellular function, converting nutrients into energy and cellular building blocks. Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) offer a holistic representation of these pathways based on an organism's genome, providing insights into its metabolic potential under various conditions. GEMs represent the collection of metabolic reactions as a [biochemical network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_network), in which nodes represent metabolites (chemical compounds) and edges are reactions in which these metabolites participate either as substrates or as products. Additionally, GEMs include the _stoichiometry_ with which a metabolite participates in each reaction (that is, the number of molecules of each metabolite involved in the reaction).By convention, positive stoichiometric coefficients represent products and negative stoichiometric coefficients represent substrates.\n",
    "\n",
    "> As a curiosity, biochemical networks cannot be represented by simple graphs, but rather by [hypergraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph), in which edges connect more than two nodes. This is because biochemical reactions may involve multiple substrates and products. \n",
    "\n",
    "As in with any graph, we can represent a biochemical network by its [incidence matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_matrix), the stoichiometric matrix, $S$, which is a central piece of a GEM. In $S$, columns represent reactions and rows metabolites. Thus, its entries $s_{ij}$ represent the stoichiometric coefficient of metabolite $i$ in reaction $j$. Most metabolites participate in a small number of reactions, so $S$ is a sparse matrix, where most of its entries are 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A toy network example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a toy biochemical network with 6 metabolites $A-F$ and 5 reactions $R_{1-5}$ to help us visualize how the stoichiometric matrix is constructed. Note that in this case all stoichiometric coefficients are 1, but in actual GEMs they can be any integer (or even a fraction in the case of the biomass pseudo-reaction). Note that column vectors represent reactions, while row vectors, metabolites:\n",

    "<img src=\"images/toy_network.png\" alt=\"toy network\" style=\"width: 20%; height: auto; margin: auto\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The stoichiometric matrix $S$ is constructed by stacking the column vectors of the network, so that the first column of $S$ is the vector representing reaction $R_1$, while the first row of $S$ is the vector representing metabolite $A$, and so on. Thus, the first entry of $S$ is the stoichiometric coefficient of metabolite $A$ in reaction $R_1$ (acting as a substrate in this case):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S = \n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "-1 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n",

    "\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, reactions transform substrates into products at a given rate, or flux. This flux is typically measured in $mmol$ of transformed product per unit time per dry weight. The interesting thing about $S$ is that it allows us to model reaction fluxes, let's name the vector of fluxes $v$. The flux vector $v$ is a vector of real numbers, where each entry $v_j$ represents the flux of reaction $j$, and it is related to the stoichiometric matrix $S$ by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d}{dt}x = Sv,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and under [steady-state]() conditions, where the concentration of each metabolite is constant, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Sv = 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is typically an underdetermined system of linear equations. Thus, instead of a single solution, we end up with a space of possible solutions, $v$, which is called the _nullspace_ of $S$. However, reaction fluxes are subject to maximum capacity and thermodynamic constraints. Ther former restricts the maximum flux of each reaction, while the latter restricts the direction of fluxes. These constraints are typically represented by a vector of lower and upper bounds, $v_{min}$ and $v_{max}$, respectively. Thus, the space of possible solutions is further restricted to the _feasible flux space_, a.k.a. the [flux cone]() $F$, which is the set of all flux vectors satisfying:\n",

    "$$F = \\{v: Sv = 0, v_{min} \\leq v \\leq v_{max}\\}.$$ \n"
