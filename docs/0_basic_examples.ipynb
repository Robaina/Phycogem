    "# Genome-scale metabolic modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Metabolic reactions underpin cellular function, converting nutrients into energy and cellular building blocks. Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) offer a holistic representation of these pathways based on an organism's genome, providing insights into its metabolic potential under various conditions. GEMs represent the collection of metabolic reactions as a [biochemical network](), in which nodes represent metabolites (chemical compounds) and edges are reactions in which these metabolites participate either as substrates or as products. Additionally, GEMs include the [stoichiometry]() with which a metabolite participates in each reaction (that is, the number of molecules of each metabolite involved in the reaction).By convention, positive stoichiometric coefficients represent products and negative stoichiometric coefficients represent substrates.\n",
    "\n",
    "> As a curiosity, biochemical networks cannot be represented by simple graphs, but rather by [hypergraphs](), in which edges connect more than two nodes. This is because biochemical reactions may involve multiple substrates and products. \n",
    "\n",
    "As in with any graph, we can represent a biochemical network by its [incidence matrix](), the stoichiometric matrix, $S$, which is a central piece of a GEM. In $S$, columns represent reactions and rows metabolites. Thus, its entries $s_{ij}$ represent the stoichiometric coefficient of metabolite $i$ in reaction $j$. Most metabolites participate in a small number of reactions, so $S$ is a sparse matrix, where most of its entries are 0.\n",
