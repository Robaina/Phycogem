    "## Metabolic Robustness Index I (MRI-I)\n",
    "\n",
    "This index measures the capacity of adaptation of a microbial community to perturbations in their composition, i.e. removal of one or several community members. Adaptability is related to functional redundancy among community members. The more redundant the community, the more robust to perturbations in their composition. Here, by functional redundancy, we mean that the community, $C = {M_1, \\dots, M_k}$ form by a collection of interacting GEMs, is able to perform a set of fundamental metabolic functions that are required to sustain the ecosystem. For instance, nitrogen fixation, primary carbon fixation, sulfate reduction, etc. We can define the collection of fundamental ecosystem metabolic tasks as a set of reactions, $F = {r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_n}$, which must be always present and potentially active in the community model. Additionally, to ensure that community members can still grow upon the perturbation, we will enforce that the biomass pseudo-reaciton of every member of the community is able to carry flux, i.e., the community is self-sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could test robustness by randomly eliminating each member in the community and then testing if the remaining community is able to sustain flux through all reactions in $F4 and still be self-sufficient under a given environment. However, by eliminating random members one by one, we are missing possible higher-order interactions, that is, submodules of more than two members that operate together to perform a required function for community growth. To account for this, we can follow a different approach, in which we will count the number of subcommunities of $C$ that meet our two requirements, since this figure is related to the robustness of the community as a whole. At one end, we have a scenario where only the entire community is able to sustain all reactions in $F$ and be self-suficient. In this case, the community as a robustness of 0, since the loss of even a single member would break our requirements. At the other end, every single species is able two meet our requirements by itself, thus interactions are not required for survival, and the robustness is at its maximum.\n",

    "The problem above may be time-consuming since it requires solving an LP for every possible subset, which scales as $2^{|C|}$, which would become unfeasible for large community sizes. We can think of a simpler index that only requires solving a single MILP. Specifically, we can aim at finding the minimum subset size among all possible subsets conditional to self-suficiency. This index would then range between 1 and $|C|$, the size of the community. Index values closer to $|C|$ would indicate a larger number of metabolic interdependencies and, hence, more fragility upon perturbations in community composition. The index would be normalized by $|C|$:\n",

    "## Identifying keynote species\n",
    "\n",
    "We could employ the two conditions defined above, i.e., performance of a minimal set of required community metabolic tasks (reactions), $F$, and self-sufficiency, i.e., positive growth of each community member, to find keynote species in the community. Keynote species would be those that are essential for the community to perform its required metabolic tasks, and maitain self-sufficiency. Thus we could remove each species, once at a time, and see if the community is still self-sufficient and able of performing all tasks in $F$. Alternative, we could rank species by the fraction of the tasks that gets lost upon removal of each species."
